    "In this notebook, we will review an advanced option of QCWare's `solve_binary` function. Current quantum hardware has both limited qubit count and limited qubit connectivity. This means that large problems cannot fit onto the quantum computer. QC Ware's platform provides the functionality to iteratively large decompose a problem into smaller subproblems, and then solve each of those subproblems on a quantum computer.\n",
