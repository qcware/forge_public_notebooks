    "## 1. Introduction <a name=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo explores the use of quantum computing (QC) for the analysis of fault trees for engineering design and testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In several industrial domains including energy, oil & gas, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and aerospace, significant computing resources are applied to system design, testing, and verification, especially related to safety compliance and regulations. Of particular interest is fault tree analysis (FTA)–determining the most probable sets of failure events in a complex system that lead to a top-level failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a top-down, deductive failure analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed using Boolean logic to combine a series of lower-level events. We aim to understand how the system can fail, to identify the best ways to reduce the failure probability, or to determine the probability of a particular system failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, NASA uses a form of FTA in order to determine the likelihood of catastrophic failure and to assess quantitative risks. They might, for instance, take the hypothetical case of a launch failure and work backwards to determine the most likely cause given their current protocols, hardware, etc. By understanding the most likely pathway \n",
    "that would lead to launch failure, NASA not only gets a better sense of how safe their launch is, but also gets the opportunity to improve their protocols based on the fault tree they develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## 2. Fault Tree Analysis Problem <a name=\"prob_description\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The fault-tree that we aim to study in this notebook looks like this:\n",
    "![](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T24940PQV-FFR7K200K/fault_tree.png?pub_secret=f370b437dc)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a top event ($p_0$) at the top, and a number of input events ($e_0, e_1,e_2, e_3$) at the bottom that correspond to a failure or error in a system component or element. The input events can take the value 0 or 1: either there is a failure on that particular component (1) or it is working properly (0). Failure of the top event would correspond to system failure. The input events are connected to each other as inputs of logic gates ($G_1,G_2,G_3,G_4$). Boolean logic in the form of a series of logic gates is used to determine what value the top event takes. These logic gates form the fault-tree that we will use in this demo. The output of each gate ($z_0, z_1, z_2$) will act as input of other gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this analysis is to find the smallest or most probable set of input events that by failing would lead to a top event failure. In general, there often are several sets of this size and thus we may find ourselves being intersted in more than one set of input events. What we are looking for is to determine how probable it is for the system to fail, or what conditions needs to be met in order for the most probable system failure to occur. This is done for safety reasons, to guarantee that the probability of the system failing is lower than the imposed treshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show the minimum cut set for the fault-tree we are studying, it corresponds to the configuration $e_0 = z_0 = z_1 = z_2 =1$ and $e_1=e_2=e_3=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T24940PQV-FFSP2V18E/fault_tree_cut_set.png?pub_secret=352f426394)\n",
    "\n",
    "Only by knowing the values of the input events ($e_i$) can the values of the other variables be derived following the logic of the fault tree. It is easy to see that this configuration leads to a top event failure $p_0=1$.\n",

    "## 3. Classical solution using ```OR-Tools```<a name=\"classical_solution\"></a>\n",
    "```OR-Tools``` is an open source software suite for optimization, available from Google. It is possible to configure ```OR-Tools``` to use commercial solvers like ```CPLEX``` or ```Gurobi```, or open-source solvers like ```SCIP``` or ```GLPK```, but this involves building ```OR-Tools``` from source, and we will not discuss this here. Instead we will focus on using Google's ```GLOP``` solver which is available upon a standard installation. More information on ```OR-Tools``` can be found at the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/overview\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">OR-Tools homepage</a>. The user guide can be found <a href=\"https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">here</a>, which contains extensive documentation and lots of examples.\n",

    "Our fault tree diagnosis problem can be expressed as a binary optimization problem. We will assign a binary variable $e_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for every input event. Logic gate outputs will also be binary variables $z_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Then our fault tree diagnosis problem can be expressed by\n",

    "This section provides a detailed explanation on how to transform fault tree logic first to PUBO (polynomial unconstrained binary optimization) and then to QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) notation that can be used as input to the quantum computer. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where $e_n,z_n,p_0 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ are binary variable vectors representing the base events, outputs of gates, and top failure, respectively. A cut set is an assignment of values  $e_n,z_n \\to v_n \\in \\{0,1\\}, p_0 \\to 1$ that satisfies $H_{consist}(v_n,1)=0$ and $H_{PUBO}(v_n,1)=N_{numfaults}$ where $N_{numfaults}$ is the number of base events that satisfy $e_i=1$. The minimal cut set is a cut set $v_n$ with a minimum number of ones in $e_n$ e.g. for a length 4 vector $e_n=(e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3)$ a cut set would correspond to $(1, 1, e_2, e_3)$ and a sample minimal cut set would be $(1, 0, 0, 0)$ as long as $H_{consist}(v_n,1)=0$ for both solutions. Invalid solutions $w_n$ would result in a penalty of the form $H_{consist}(w_n,1)>0$. Thus, the minimum value of the $H_{PUBO}$ function would correspond to the shortest minimal cut set solution, higher value solutions would be minimal cut sets and super cut sets, and the highest values are given by invalid solutions. Our aim is to generate the $H_{PUBO}$ objective function that verifies mathematically the following two claims: an assignment $V$ such that the cost function $H_{PUBO}(V)$ takes its absolute minimum $H_{PUBO/min}$ corresponds to the shortest minimal cut set of the tree; we cannot claim the converse, that to every cut set there is an assignment $V$ such that $H_{PUBO}(V)=H_{PUBO/min}$. However, the quantum computer will generate solutions at and near the minimum in a probabilistic manner, finding shortest minimal cut sets, minimal cut sets, and super cut sets, and we will use postprocessing to validate solutions and to generate the final minimal cut set list.\n",

It is not enough to make the substitution in the $H_{PUBO}$ expression to obtain $H_{QUBO}$, since the ancillas are new variables whose values are independent of the original variables, we need to penalize the incorrect variable assignments.

    "The QC Ware Platform returns a solution that minimizes the cost. If the number of runs for each solver is not specified, it will run each solver several times and return the solution with the lowest cost. The returned solutions forms a characteristic distribution for each solver in the cost value spectrum. This means that each solver will not only return the lowest cost solution but also some suboptimal solutions. The platform then finds the best and returns it as the ultimate solution. Since this distribution is an inherent property of quantum systems there is a chance that some of the returned solutions will not be feasible i.e. the faulty events do not generate a top failure. So, we need to check if the returned solutions are feasible before applying them to our business problem. For some fault-trees it is possible that there are multiple solutions to the problem, and so we will have to gather different solutions with the same minimum number of faulty events in order to have a complete set of solutions."
