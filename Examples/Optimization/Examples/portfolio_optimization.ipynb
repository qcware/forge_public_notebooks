    "Portfolio optimization is the problem of optimally allocating a budget to a collection of assets. Real world examples can be found throughout the stock market world: groups and individuals want to invest their money in order to maximize profit and minimize risk.  Here, \"optimal\" can mean a number of different things.  For example, one could define \"optimal\" to mean that the expected value of the return is maximized, though in practice this naive approach is typically not very useful. Ultimately, \"optimality\" is precisly definied via an objective function, which we cover in more detail in the next section.\n",

    "<a href=\"https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/courses/ma362/07F/markowitz_JF.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Markowitz</a>.  Informally speaking, Markowitz proposed that an allocation is optimal whenever the corresponding expected return is maximized <em>and</em> variance is minimized.  In other words, one seeks to maximize gains, while at the same time minimize risk. The following diagram will give you a sense of how we'll be approaching this problem.\n",

Given that Ising and QUBO problems are equivalent under the appropriate transformation, one can in turn use these to obtain the QUBO forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's formally define the problem. Suppose the decision maker has a total budget $B$ she must allocate among $n$ assets. For each asset, $i$, we assume she has the option to allocate either some non-zero quantity $B_i>0$, or $0$. In this set-up, her choice is a binary one: either buy a $B_i$ of the asset or none at all. Because we can't invest more money than we have, we know that\n",

As the name suggests, this solver simply loops over all possible solutions, and keeps track of the configuration with the lowest energy.  Due to its primitive nature, this algorithm is limited to rather small problem sizes in practice.  On the other hand, because this algorithm returns the global optima with probability 1, it can be used with smaller problems as a debugging tool."
