    "# 2. Detailed problem description <a id=\"prob_description\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many different ways of formally modelling the problem, here we focus on a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model of the problem.  This allows us to treat the problem both on universal quantum computers as well as on special purpose quantum annealers.  Before we proceed, we briefly mention that for Operations Research professionals wondering how to formulate their problems as a QUBO, the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.5843.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">Ising formulations of many NP problems</a>, by Andrew Lucas, 2014, gives <em>Ising</em> formulations of many NP problems.  Given that Ising and QUBO problems are equivalent under the appropriate transformation, one can in turn use these to obtain the QUBO forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now formally define the problem.  Suppose we are interested in completing $N$ jobs,  and we have access to $m$ workers who can complete these jobs.  Furthermore, assume each job $i\\in\\{1,\\dots,N\\}$ takes time $L_i$ to complete.  While other formulations are certainly possible, here we make the simplifying assumption that a given job will take each worker the same amount of time, i.e., $L_i$ is independent of the worker $\\alpha\\in\\{1,\\dots,m\\}$.  Let $V_{\\alpha}$ be the set of jobs assigned to worker $\\alpha$.  Define the length of the worker $\\alpha$ to be \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "M_{\\alpha}:=\\sum_{i\\in V_{\\alpha}}L_i.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Our goal is to assign jobs to workers in such a way that $\\text{max}(M_{\\alpha})$ is minimized.  This means that the makespan of the project is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $i,\\alpha$, we introduce a binary decision variable $x_{i,\\alpha}$ which equals 1 if job $i$ is assigned to worker $\\alpha$, and 0 otherwise.  Without loss of generality, assume that $M_{1}\\geq M_{\\alpha}$.  Under this assumption, the goal would be to minimize, over all feasible assignments of the decision variables, the term\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "H_{B}:=BM_{1}=B\\sum_{i=1}^{N}L_ix_{i,1},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $B\\in(0,\\infty]$ is a scaling parameter we choose later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.a. The constraints <a id=\"the_constraints\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by \"feasible\" assignments?  We are only interested in assigmnets of the decision variables which satisfy the following two constraints:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{m}x_{i,\\alpha}=1 \\; \\forall \\; i\\in\\{1,\\dots,N\\}, \\tag{Constraint 1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "and\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "M_{1}\\geq M_{\\alpha} \\; \\forall \\; \\alpha\\in\\{2,\\dots,m\\} \\tag{Constraint 2}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The first constraint can be interpreted as the requirement that each job be assigned to precisely one worker.  The second constraint can be interpreted as the requirement that no worker have an assignment of jobs which takes longer to complete than those of worker 1.  We will enforce these constraints by including the appropriate penalty functions in the final objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraint 1: Ensuring each job is assigned\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with Constraint 1, which is simpler to take care of.  To do so, we simply need to include a term of the form\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "H^{1}_{A}:=A\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(1-\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{m}x_{i,\\alpha}\\right)^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $A\\in(0,\\infty)$ is a scaling parameter we choose later.  Note that $H^{1}_{A}\\geq 0$, and it equals 0 (i.e., it's minimum) if and only if the assignment satisfies Constraint 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraint 2: Ensuring worker 1 has more work than any other worker\n",
    "\n",
    "The second constraint is a bit trickier to enforce.  First, introduce an additional binary decision variable $y_{n,\\alpha}$ for each $\\alpha\\in\\{2,\\dots,m\\}, n\\in\\{0,\\dots,\\lfloor\\log_{2}\\mathcal{M}\\rfloor\\}$.  We will elaborate on $\\mathcal{M}$ shortly.  For now, consider the expression\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "H^{2}_{A}:=A\\sum_{\\alpha=2}^{m}\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\lfloor\\log_{2}\\mathcal{M}\\rfloor}2^ny_{n,\\alpha}+\\sum_{i=1}^{N}L_{i}(x_{i,\\alpha}-x_{i,1})\\right)^2.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Note that $H^{2}_{A}\\geq0$, and it equals 0 (i.e., its minimum) whenever \\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{n=0}^{\\lfloor\\log_{2}\\mathcal{M}\\rfloor}2^ny_{n,\\alpha}+\\sum_{i=1}^{N}L_{i}(x_{i,\\alpha}-x_{i,1})\\overset{!}{=}0 \\; \\forall \\; \\alpha\\in\\{2,\\dots,m\\}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Because $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\lfloor\\log_{2}\\mathcal{M}\\rfloor}2^ny_{n,\\alpha}\\geq 0$, the above equation can hold only if $\\sum_{i=1}^{N}L_{i}(x_{i,\\alpha}-x_{i,1})=M_{\\alpha}-M_{1}\\leq0 \\; \\forall \\; \\alpha\\in\\{2,\\dots,m\\}$, i.e., precisely if Constraint 2 is satisfied!  More specifically, assuming $M_{\\alpha}-M_{1}\\leq0$, note that the above equation holds whenever the $\\{y_{n,\\alpha}\\}$ are the digits in the binary expansion of $M_{\\alpha}-M_{1}$.  This means that $\\mathcal{M}$ needs to be large enough so that $\\lfloor\\log_{2}\\mathcal{M}+1\\rfloor$ binary digits suffice to express $M_{\\alpha}-M_{1}$.  That holds whenever $\\mathcal{M}\\overset{!}{\\geq} M_{\\alpha}-M_{1}$.  Because $M_{\\alpha}-M_{1}\\leq N\\max_{i}L_{i}$, we can ensure this by choosing $\\mathcal{M}=N\\max_{i}L_{i}$.\n",
