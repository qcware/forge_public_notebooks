    "A fundamental operation encountered in qubit hardware is the process of measurement. Generally, one prepares a quantum state by running a quantum circuit and then projectively measures each qubit to determine if that qubit ends up in the $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ state. The collective measurement result over all qubits is a binary string, e.g., $|0011\\rangle$, which we refer to as a `Ket`. This procedure is repeated `nmeasurement` times, with different `Ket`s appearing probabilistically according to the square of the amplitude of each `Ket` in the quantum state. The fundamental output from this overall process is a histogram of `Ket` strings observed together with the the probability that each one was observed and the total number of measurements. We refer to this overall output as a `ProbabilityHistogram` object. An alternative output in terms of histogram of `Ket` strings observed together with the the integral number of times that each one was observed is provided as the `CountHistogram` object - utility functions exist to quickly convert back and forth between `ProbabilityHistogram` and `CountHistogram`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naming:** The names of these two classes were selected after much debate. For `Ket`, we could have used `int` with a fixed endian condition, `str` which we would trust the user to always be composed of `0` and `1`, or a class which could alternatively be named `Ket`, `String`, or `Configuration`. We decided to use `Ket` to force the order, typing, and correctness of this concept, and to make the indexing of `ProbabilityHistogram` and `CountHistogram` also support direct indexing by `str` (cast to `Ket` under the hood) to make things easy. For `ProbabilityHistogram`, we could have used a `dict` or other map, or a class which could alternatively be named `Histogram`, `Counts`, `Shots`, `Probabilities` or any variation thereof. We decided to use `MeasurementResult` to keep things maximally explicit. Note that most users will encounter these objects as the output of `quasar` library methods, and will rarely need to explicitly construct `Ket`, `ProbabilityHistogram`, or `CountHistogram` objects. In this case, the manipulation of these data structures seems straightforward, and allows for easy casting to other data structures that the user might prefer."
